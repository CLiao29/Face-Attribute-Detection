# Face-Attribute-Detection
## Abstract ##
This project is mainly concerned with implementing two light-weight models, MobileNet, and its optimized version, MobileNetV2, to classify various face attributes in the CelebA dataset, which contains 200K of facial images from celebrities. In addition, it also investigates the effect of using transfer learning to study demographic information, such as Gender, prior to learning the attribute detection. It turns out that the overall accuracy of MobileNet and MobileNetV2 reaches 90% and 86% on the CelebA dataset. In addition, by comparing the results, it is concluded that transfer learning can largely help in facial classifications for attributes that are relevant to demographic differences.
